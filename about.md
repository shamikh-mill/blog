I'm a data enthusiast, history lover, and spicy ramen junkie from Dallas, TX, currently an undergraduate at Duke University in Durham, NC.
I like learning new things that involve numbers and technology, and applying what I learn to try and predict other things. This blog is part of my effort to document what I try and, hopefully, learn along the way. Welcome to my blog!
