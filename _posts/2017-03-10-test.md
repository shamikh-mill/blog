So, as a college student learning about a whole lot of different things, I felt like it was time to start a tech blog. Here, I’ll be documenting some technical as well as random endeavors as a sort of online “repository” (I know, can’t escape it) for my thoughts.
Here are some of my goals for the following new year and semester:

1) Learn core concepts of computer science

2) Become stronger and more endurant

3) Develop more web applications that make people’s lives easier

4) Learn to play chess

5) Learn linear algebra and statistics

6) Play with data

7) Meet someone new everyday

8) Spend less money

9) Reprioritize my religion

10) Learn sci-kit learn (pun intended)
