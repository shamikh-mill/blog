This is an agglomeration of my notes from various resources on the subject of deep learning and neural networks, which I will be using in my research this summer. Some of the primary sources used are DataCamp courses. 

Lesson 1: Introduction to Deep Learning  

- Deep learning is used for high-dimensional datasets in which the variables often interact with one another. Deep learning uses neural networks that account for these interactions. 
- Neural networks take variables that interact and calculate a function of those variables that accounts for their interaction, and use this to predict the outcome. 
- Diagram for neural network: input layer (variables/features) and output layers, and all non-input or non-output layers are called hidden layers. These are not observed directly from the real world. Each node in the hidden layer is an aggregation of information from the input data. Each node adds to the modelâ€™s ability to capture interactions.  


Lesson 2: Forward Propagation   
- Lines connect the input to the hidden layer, with a number that represents the weight. To calculate the number associated with the hidden layers
