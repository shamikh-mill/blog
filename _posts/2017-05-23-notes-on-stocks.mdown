With new trading platforms and applications truly democratizing the power to buy and sell stocks, there are plentiful interesting and affordable ways to get involved with the stock market. A particulary cool application called RobinHood emerged that allowed one to buy and sell stocks without commision, and so I decided to get involved. As a complete beginner with only an Econ 101 exposure to markets and practically zero understanding of finance, I decided to compile some notes about stock trading in general. Then, I sought to create some Jupyter notebooks that enabled me to get some quick price analysis information on the stocks that I owned, which are essentially Python scripts in which I imported stock prices using the Yahoo Finance Python module (there are plenty of stock market API's you can use, Oanda, Quandl, etc.) The notebook can be found [here](https://github.com/shamikh-mill/stock-checker/blob/master/price-checker.ipynb).  

Disclaimer- as a complete beginner on a learning experience, some of these strategies can be outright incorrect, in which case I'd love to be informed of and learn the real way to do things. 

- From Investopedia: Stocks are shares in the ownership of a company, and represent a claim on a company's assets and earnings. But its important to understand that stockholders (or shareholders) don't own the company itself, instead the shares that are issued by the companies.  
- Portfolio - grouping of financial assets. 
- Bullish stocks - characterized by rising share prices. 
- Bearish stocks - characterized by falling share prices.  
- You, as the investor, seek to minimize your losses (the total loss in price of your portfolio) and maximize your return, the gains in price. RobinHood will show you your average cost for your shares and the total return on that stock, which are important to keep track of. 

RobinHood allows you to buy and sell stocks on the open market without paying a fee. To be able to trade, you have to register an account using your social security number and wait a few days for approval.  
The app's interface is intuitive and simple. You can add stocks to your watchlist, and view a graph of its price per share in time periods from a day to five years. It's easy to see using these why FANG stocks (Facebook, Apple, Netflix, and Google) are some of the most high-performing stocks tech stocks- looking back a few years, we see steady, linear increases in their values.

1. Buying- Probably the part of investment that gets the most attention, just because the price you buy at singlehandedly determines whether or not you have an actual return. Analysts look at so, so many factors both inside companies and in the aggregate economy to try and find the most auspicious shares, the ones that minimize risk and maximize return. How do you know when to buy?  
To determine which stocks to buy, I simply keep an ear out for companies that are doing well- releasing new products soon, etc. It's also important to guage public opinion on these matters. For example, when United Airlines got themselves into the Dr. Dao controversy and took enormous criticism, their stock ($UAL) took a 4% hit (from about $72 to about $68, which is a huge deal) and the company lost millions of dollars.  
But to bring in a more rigorous aspect to buying (or selling for that matter) it's important to check out analyst reviews for stocks. Some great websites for this would be [Barchart.com](https://Barchart.com), [marketwatch.com](https://marketwatch.com), and [stocktwits.com](https://stocktwits.com). Ratings are provided for each stock which advise to overweight (buy more), underweight (sell some), hold (keep your shares). When a stock is marked as overweight, it is expected to "outperform its industry in the market"- from Investopedia this can be "due to a steady stream of positive news, good earnings and raised guidance.". 
2. Holding- Dealing in stocks can require a frustrating amount of patience. Sometimes it can be better to hold than to sell your shares even if a stock is bearish; plentiful ratings from online services evidence this.  
3. Selling- important, because while buying can set you up for profit, it's not ensured until you actually sell. It's often hard to sell (bullish stocks) because mentally you want its share price to perhaps continue its upward trend, making you more money, but as outlined in "The Casino Trade" on Investopedia this can often lead to a frustrating loss when you wait too long and eventually just sell off shares at much lower prices than what once was.
